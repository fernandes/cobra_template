# Component-Based Rails Applications (#cobra)

Cobra is a way to organize your rails application, imagine it like a new way for packaging your rails apps

What you get using this template?

In your wrapper application:

* A component template so you can customize your way
* copy_template.sh script that copies template to a new component
* A gitignore with proper entries to #cobra

In your component template:

* Automatically runs its migration on wrapper application
* Automatically require dependencies on wrapper application
* Has everything ready to test (rspec/factory girl/database cleaner/shoulda-matchers)
