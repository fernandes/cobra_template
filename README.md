# Component-Based Rails Applications (#cobra)

Cobra is a way to organize your rails application, imagine it like a new way for packaging your rails apps

What you get using this template:

* A component template so you can customize your way
* Component Template monkeypatched so rails include its migrations
* copy_template.sh script that copies template to a new component
